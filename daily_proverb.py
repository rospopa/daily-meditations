# Proverbs from Proverbs 22:17-24:22 - The Sayings of the Wise
PROVERBS = [
    "Pay attention and turn your ear to the sayings of the wise; apply your heart to what I teach, for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart and have all of them ready on your lips. (Proverbs 22:17-18)",
    "So that your trust may be in the LORD, I teach you today, even you. (Proverbs 22:19)",
    "Have I not written thirty sayings for you, sayings of counsel and knowledge, teaching you to be honest and to speak the truth, so that you bring back truthful reports to those you serve? (Proverbs 22:20-21)",
    "Do not exploit the poor because they are poor and do not crush the needy in court, for the LORD will take up their case and will exact life for life. (Proverbs 22:22-23)",
    "Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person, do not associate with one easily angered, or you may learn their ways and get yourself ensnared. (Proverbs 22:24-25)",
    "Do not be one who shakes hands in pledge or puts up security for debts; if you lack the means to pay, your very bed will be snatched from under you. (Proverbs 22:26-27)",
    "Do not move an ancient boundary stone set up by your ancestors. (Proverbs 22:28)",
    "Do you see someone skilled in their work? They will serve before kings; they will not serve before officials of low rank. (Proverbs 22:29)",
    "When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what is before you, and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony. Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive. (Proverbs 23:1-3)",
    "Do not wear yourself out to get rich; do not trust your own cleverness. Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle. (Proverbs 23:4-5)",
    "Do not eat the food of a begrudging host, do not crave his delicacies; for he is the kind of person who is always thinking about the cost. 'Eat and drink,' he says to you, but his heart is not with you. (Proverbs 23:6-7)",
    "You will vomit up the little you have eaten and will have wasted your compliments. (Proverbs 23:8)",
    "Do not speak to fools, for they will scorn your prudent words. (Proverbs 23:9)",
    "Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless, for their Defender is strong; he will take up their case against you. (Proverbs 23:10-11)",
    "Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge. (Proverbs 23:12)",
    "Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish them with the rod, they will not die. Punish them with the rod and save them from death. (Proverbs 23:13-14)",
    "My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad indeed; my inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right. (Proverbs 23:15-16)",
    "Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD. There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off. (Proverbs 23:17-18)",
    "Listen, my son, and be wise, and set your heart on the right path: Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat, for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags. (Proverbs 23:19-21)",
    "Listen to your father, who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old. (Proverbs 23:22)",
    "Buy the truth and do not sell itâ€”wisdom, instruction and insight as well. (Proverbs 23:23)",
    "The father of a righteous child has great joy; a man who fathers a wise son rejoices in him. May your father and mother rejoice; may she who gave you birth be joyful! (Proverbs 23:24-25)",
    "My son, give me your heart and let your eyes delight in my ways, for an adulterous woman is a deep pit, and a wayward wife is a narrow well. Like a bandit she lies in wait and multiplies the unfaithful among men. (Proverbs 23:26-28)",
    "Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine. (Proverbs 23:29-30)",
    "Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly! In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper. (Proverbs 23:31-32)",
    "Your eyes will see strange sights, and your mind will imagine confusing things. You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging. (Proverbs 23:33-34)",
    "They hit me,' you will say, 'but I'm not hurt! They beat me, but I don't feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?' (Proverbs 23:35)",
    "Do not envy the wicked, do not desire their company; for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about making trouble. (Proverbs 24:1-2)",
    "By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding it is established; through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures. (Proverbs 24:3-4)",
    "The wise prevail through great power, and those who have knowledge muster their strength. Surely you need guidance to wage war, and victory is won through many advisers. (Proverbs 24:5-6)",
    "Wisdom is too high for fools; in the assembly at the gate they must not open their mouths. (Proverbs 24:7)"
